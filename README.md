# Dry Volume Zones

This resource allows you to create and manage dry volume zones in your FiveM server. These zones are areas where water effects do not applyâ€”meaning water will not affect players or objects within the defined volumes. This is useful for preventing water from flooding interiors, underground areas, or custom map locations. The script uses `ox_lib` for zone management and the native `CreateDryVolume` function to define these special areas.

## How It Works

- **Dry Volumes**: The script creates AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) volumes where water does not affect the player or environment. Only water created from drawables and collisions is affected; waterquads and other water sources are not impacted.
- **Use Cases**: Prevents water from flooding interiors, basements, or custom map areas that should remain dry, even if they are below the waterline.
- **Note**: This does not affect waterquads, only water created from drawables and collisions. Do not create dry volumes while your local ped is swimming.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure `ox_lib` is installed and started before this resource.

## Configuration

### Config.lua

The `Config.lua` file contains the configuration for the dry volume zones. You can add multiple zones by editing the `Config.zones` table. Each zone should have the following properties:

- `id`: A unique identifier for the zone.
- `points`: An array of `vec3` points defining the zone's boundaries.
- `thickness`: The thickness of the zone.

Example:

```lua
Config.zones = {
    {
        id = "apartment_pool",
        points = {
            vec3(93.300003051758, -362.14999389648, 43.0),
            vec3(76.449996948242, -362.14999389648, 43.0),
            vec3(76.400001525879, -379.0, 43.0),
            vec3(93.300003051758, -379.0, 43.0),
        },
        thickness = 85.45,
    },
    -- Add more zones here as needed
}
```

### Debug Mode

You can enable debug mode by setting `Config.debug = true` in `Config.lua`. This will print additional information about the zones, such as when a player enters or exits a zone, and details about the created dry volumes.

## Usage

1. Ensure `ox_lib` is running.
2. Start this resource.
3. The zones defined in `Config.lua` will be created automatically, and water effects will not apply within those volumes.
